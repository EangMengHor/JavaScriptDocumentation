                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language, every browser has a JavaScript interpreter(used to understand JavaScript's codes).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elemetns such as operators, control, structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be exteneded for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for instance:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                             <li>
                                  Client-side (someone who uses your website) JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Objct Model (MOD). For example, Client-side extenstions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to the user when a button is clicked, mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                             </li>

                        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript langauge resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the main differences are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is all-text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.
                        </li>

                            Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open your favorite browser and type <strong>Control + Shift + C</strong>, after that go to <b>Console</b> and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code: 
                    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello "+ yourName);} 
greetMe("World") </code>
                    After you wrote down the code, click <b>Enter</b>

                    Variables in JavaScript are like those of Math. They are used to store values in your application. the names of variables, called <strong>identifiers</strong>, conform to certain rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifiers must start with a <i>letter</i>, <i>underscore(_)</i>, or <i>dollar sign ($)</i>; the next characters can also be digits (0-9). And JavaScript is case sensitive meaning a variable called <i>x</i> is different from <i>X</i>.

                <article>
                    You can declare a variable in 3 ways
                    <p>
                        With the keyword var. For example,
                        <code>var x = 42</code>
                        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By simply assigning it a value, this is the easiest way. For example,
                        <code>x = 42</code>
                        Even though, it is the easist it is not the safest. This always declares a global variable. It generate a strict JavaScript warning. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the keyword <b>let</b>. For example,
                        <code>let y = 12</code>
                        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable, See Variable Scope below.
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <p>
                        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <b>global variable</b>, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function it is called a <b>local variable</b>, because it is only available within the function defined.
                    </p>
                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5}
console.log(y)</code>
                    <p>    
                        This would not print out 5, this is because y is only defined inside the if statement(local variable)

                <article>
                    <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax. </p>
                    <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber. </p>

                    <p>
                        You can create a read-only, name constant with the <b>const</b> keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier. It must start with a <b>letter</b>, <b>underscore(_)</b>, or a <b>dollar sign ($)</b>.
                    </p>
                    <code>const PI = 3.14</code>
                    <p>
                        A constant cannot change value through the document or be re-declared while the script is running. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example,
                    </p>                   
                    <code>function f() {};
const f = 5; // This will cause an error.
function f() {const g = 5, var g;}; // This will also cause an error. </code>

                        The lastest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean. (true and false)</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined</li>
                            <li>Number. 42, 42.00.</li>
                            <li>String. A string always has quotation('') or double quotation(""), for example "CodingIsFun" is a String</li>
                            <li>Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    You can think of object as named containers for values, and functions as proedures that your application can perform.

                <article>
                        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement when the condition is false. An if statement looks as follow:                   
                        <code>if (condition){ 
    statement_1;
    }  else { 
    statement_2;}  </code>                  
                        Condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. For example, (1&gt;2) would evaluate to false. If the first statement is executed (true) then it stops, else if it is false it goes to the second statement.             
                        Having multiple conditions is fine, for example:
                        <code>if (condition_1){ 
    statement_1;
    } else if (condition_2){ 
    statement_2; 
    }else{ 
    statement_3 
    } </code>

                <article>
                        A while statement exrcutes its as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
                        <code> while (condition) statement</code>
                        If the condition becomes false, statemnet within the loop stops. 
                        <p>
                            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.

                        <p>
                            TO execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({...}) to group those statements
                        </p>
                        Example:
                        <p>
                            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                        </p>
                        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) {n++; x+= n;</code>
                        <p>

                            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                        </p>                        
                         <ul>
                            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>
                            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                            true, so the loop terminates.
                        </p>

                    A function defintion (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the function</li>
                        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses() and seperated by commas(;).</li>
                        <li>The JavaScript statement that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets({}).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For example, the following code defines a simple function named squareNun:
                    </p>
                    <code>function squareNum(number) {return number * number}</code>
                    <p>
                        The function square takes on argument, call number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the arguement(number) of the function, multiplied by itself.
